# Why I did that

|        |         |         |         |         |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Date   | 2019-09 | 2020-03 | 2021-12 | 2021-12 |
| Weight | 62.0 kg | 63.5kg  | 67 kg   | 67 kg   |

Beyond the weight 

- I wasn't happy with what the mirror was showing me
- I was feeling heavy on boulders
- Had to choose between loosing some weight or buy new clothes
- I knew that, the more I wait, the harder it will be

# Framework principles

The main principles

1. No weight loss without calorie deficit (nor gain without calorie surplus)
2. We usually talk about weight loss, when we mean fat loss
   1. Loosing weight != loosing fat
   2. Loosing weight = loosing muscle + water + fat
3. The goal is to optimize the fat loss, the best way to do so is to minimize the muscle loss by
   1. Providing enough protein
   2. Using muscles, if possible in a way to stimulate muscle growth

# My initial parameters

| Weight | Body fat | Activity factor | Deficit | Protein factor | Lipid factor |
|--------|----------|-----------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| 66kg   | 20%      | 1.35            | 20%     | 2.3 g/kg       | 1.5 g/kg     |

Thoses factors are used to compute daily calories and macro goals

| Maintenance  | Deficit     | Goal         | Protein  | Lipid   | Carbohydrate |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 2095 calorie | 420 calorie | 1675 calorie | 125 g/kg | 80 g/kg | 115 g/kg     |

<!--
- Weight, measured
- Body fat, measured or estimated
- Activity factor, estimated
  - 1.1: a few or no exercices
  - 1.2: exercice 1-2 times a week
  - 1.35: exercice 3-5 times a week
  - 1.45: exercice 6-7 times a week
  - 1.6 - 1.8: exercice 6-7 times a week + physical work
- Deficit, should be between 10% and 25%
  - This higher it is, the higher should the protein factor be
  - The higher, the harder
- Protein factor
   - Between 1.5 and 2.3
- Lipid factor
   - At least 0.7
- Carbohydrate
   - The rest

# Parameters from studies

| What          | Calorie     |
|---------------|-------------|
| Protein       | 4 calorie/g |
| Lipid         | 9 calorie/g |
| Carbohydrates | 4 calorie/g |

# The first adjustments

After a week, I felt frustrated, tired and starving all day and night. 
Could not concentrate nor train as I wanted.

What I've changed

- Drink more water (3-4l a day)
- Adjust goal with a lower deficit
- Use circularity calorie
- Double up vegetables to fill my stomach
